 <para>
  <filename>gapless_seq</> provides a sequence implementation that never
  has gaps in the sequence of values it produces, even after rollback or
  a crash.
 </para>

 <para>
  The consequence of this capability is that every nextval() request
  writes a WAL record recording the latest state of the sequence.
  This could be very costly and is not recommended for general
  usage except in specific applications that require this feature.
